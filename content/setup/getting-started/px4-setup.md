# PX4 Setup


<div class="adm adm-note"><p class="adm-title">Note</p>

PX4 is currently used for the real robot exclusively and is not part of the simulation. Skip this section if you are **not** preparing for the lab experiments. If in doubt ask your supervisor.



</div>

## Building the Firmware


If PX4 is used in combination with the onboard computer, make sure the firmware running on the FCU was built with RTPS support.


A tested PX4-Version is the commit `45b390b0bf`.


```console
$ git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git \
&& cd PX4-Autopilot \
&& git checkout 45b390b0bf \
&& git submodule update --init --recursive
```

For this version the RTPS support is *not* enabled by default for the `fmu-v4` target (i.e. the PixRacer). One has to modify the file `boards/px4/fmu-v4/default.px4board` and add the line


```sh
CONFIG_MODULES_MICRODDS_CLIENT=y
```

Also modify the autostart-line in `src/modules/microdds_client/module.yaml` if you want to have a namespace prepended to the topic names


```sh
set XRCE_DDS_ARGS "-t serial -d ${SERIAL_DEV} -b p:${BAUD_PARAM} -n uuv00"
```

Also a good starting point for a minimal set of bridged topics defined in `src/modules/microdds_client/dds_topics.yaml` is


```yaml
publications:

  - topic: /fmu/out/failsafe_flags
    type: px4_msgs::msg::FailsafeFlags

  - topic: /fmu/out/sensor_combined
    type: px4_msgs::msg::SensorCombined

  - topic: /fmu/out/timesync_status
    type: px4_msgs::msg::TimesyncStatus

  - topic: /fmu/out/vehicle_odometry
    type: px4_msgs::msg::VehicleOdometry

subscriptions:

  - topic: /fmu/in/vehicle_visual_odometry
    type: px4_msgs::msg::VehicleOdometry
```

Build the firmware


<div class="tabs">

<div class="tab" data-label="PixRacer">

```sh
make px4_fmu-v4
```

</div>

<div class="tab" data-label="PixRacer Docker">

```sh
./Tools/docker_run.sh 'make px4_fmu-v4'
```

</div>

<div class="tab" data-label="PixHawk 6C">

```sh
make px4_fmu-v6c
```

</div>

<div class="tab" data-label="PixHawk 6C Docker">

```sh
./Tools/docker_run.sh 'make px4_fmu-v6c'
```

</div>


</div>

Normally, the `microdds_client` is started automatically, and no further actions are required. Anyhow, to manually start the `microdds_client`, go to the `nsh` terminal and run


```console
$ microdds_client start -t serial -d /dev/ttyS2 -b 921600 -n uuv00
```

## Configure the Firmware


<div class="adm adm-attention"><p class="adm-title">Attention</p>

Make sure you disable the GPS completely by changing its control mode parameter. Otherwise the the vision will be taken as odometry data instead of absolute positions.



</div>

Set `XRCE_DDS_0_CFG` to `TELEM2`, i.e. `102`. If you want to, you can change the baudrate of TELEM2 at `SER_TEL2_BAUD`. But the default of 921600 should be just fine.


<div class="adm adm-note"><p class="adm-title">Note</p>

Make sure you disable all MAVLink interfaces on `TELEM2`.



</div>

## Install px4_msgs


<div class="adm adm-hint"><p class="adm-title">Hint</p>

Building **and** rebuilding `px4_msgs` takes very long, especially on the Raspberry Pi. Therefore, it is recommended to have an underlying workspace for packages that we are not modifying regularly.



</div>

A commit that is tested to be working with the above-mentioned version of PX4 is `8a7f3da`.


Clone it into the ROS workspace


```console
$ git clone https://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs.git \
&& cd px4_msgs \
&& checkout 8a7f3da
```

## Install Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent


Clone and build the agent


```console
$ cd ~/ros2_underlay/src \
&& git clone https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent.git \
&& build_underlay
```

## Running the Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent


Replace device and baudrate with the correct values.


```console
$ MicroXRCEAgent serial --dev /dev/fcu_data -b 921600
```

If the setup is working, `ros2 topic list` should show the FMUs in and out topics.


```sh
/uuv00/fmu/in/obstacle_distance [px4_msgs/msg/ObstacleDistance]
/uuv00/fmu/in/offboard_control_mode [px4_msgs/msg/OffboardControlMode]
/uuv00/fmu/in/onboard_computer_status [px4_msgs/msg/OnboardComputerStatus]
/uuv00/fmu/in/sensor_optical_flow [px4_msgs/msg/SensorOpticalFlow]
/uuv00/fmu/in/telemetry_status [px4_msgs/msg/TelemetryStatus]
/uuv00/fmu/in/trajectory_setpoint [px4_msgs/msg/TrajectorySetpoint]

/uuv00/fmu/out/vehicle_status [px4_msgs/msg/VehicleStatus]
```

## MAVLink Router / QGroundControl


QGroundControl is very useful to set parameters and to calibrate the sensors of the FCU. The MAVLink Router is needed to connect to the QGroundControl App on your (Desktop) computer.


If not installed on the Raspberry Pi of the vehicle:


```console
$ git clone https://github.com/mavlink-router/mavlink-router.git \
&& cd mavlink-router \
&& git checkout 3b48da1
```

Build and install the code following the [official instructions](https://github.com/mavlink-router/mavlink-router).



The configuration file is at `/etc/mavlink-router/main.conf` and can contain the following:


```ini
[General]

[UartEndpoint USB]

# Path to UART device. like `/dev/ttyS0`
# Mandatory, no default value
Device =/dev/ttyACM0
Baud = 921600

[UdpEndpoint hippo-celsius]
Mode = normal
Address = 192.168.0.115
Port = 14550
```

Adjust the address to your ground control computer's IP address if you are not using the `hippo-celsius` Desktop computer within the lab.


<div class="adm adm-attention"><p class="adm-title">Attention</p>

The UDP Endpoint currently does not work for the very first connection. Manual way of connecting via TCP is described below.




</div>

Run the router via


```console
$ mavlink-routerd
```

## Manual Connection to QGroundControl


First, the mavlink router needs to be running on the vehicle.


In QGC, click on the top left corner icon -&gt; Application settings -&gt; Comm links -&gt; Add



![qgc where to find settings](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr76gues0/image/upload/v1788428918/hippocampus-docs/setup/qgc_where_to_find_settings.png)

<p class="figcaption">Where to find the settings.</p>

Add a TCP comm link with standard settings. Add the vehicle's name and IP address. It should look like this:


![qgc manually add tcp connection](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr76gues0/image/upload/v1788428914/hippocampus-docs/setup/qgc_manually_add_tcp_connection.png)

<p class="figcaption">TCP comm link settings for UUV02.</p>

Now, you should be able to connect. The vehicle setup page should open:


![qgc vehicle setup](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr76gues0/image/upload/v1788428916/hippocampus-docs/setup/qgc_vehicle_setup.png)

<div class="adm adm-note"><p class="adm-title">Note</p>

After this first manual connection via TCP from your ground control station to the vehicle, the UDP endpoint should/will start working.




</div>

## Sensor Calibration


You might have to calibrate the vehicle's sensors. Click on Sensors:


![qgc sensors setup](https://res.cloudinary.com/dr76gues0/image/upload/v1788428915/hippocampus-docs/setup/qgc_sensors_setup.png)

and follow the instructions.
