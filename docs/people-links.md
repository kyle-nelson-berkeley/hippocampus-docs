# People-card link resolution

*Companion to `data/people.json` — records, per person, why a card links where it does (or
why it has no link), so a `null` link is distinguishable from a failed lookup. Resolved
2026-09-03. The rules (Kyle, 2026-09-03): a card links the person's personal TUHH page when
one exists; otherwise a personal page only at ≥90% identity confidence where the page itself
shows TUHH/HippoCampus affiliation; otherwise no link. LinkedIn/ResearchGate/Scholar
profiles are deliberately never linked (login walls, instability); found ones are listed as
candidates. `tools/check_urls.py` probes every non-null link for liveness.*

| Person | Resolution | Link |
|---|---|---|
| Kyle Nelson | RESOLVED 2026-09-03 (was flagged: the auto-generated project URL `portfolio-kyle-nelson-berkeleys-projects.vercel.app` 302s to Vercel SSO). Kyle supplied the public production alias, which serves the latest production deployment without disabling deployment protection — verified 200 anonymously. | https://kyle-nelson-berkeley.vercel.app |
| Nathalie Bauschmann | Personal TUHH page, verified 200 | https://www.tuhh.de/mum/team/wimi/nathalie-bauschmann |
| Vincent Lenz | Personal TUHH page, verified 200 | https://www.tuhh.de/mum/team/wimi/vincent-lenz |
| Finn Breuer | CORRECTED BY KYLE 2026-09-03: the lab people page lists him as "Finn Busch" — that surname is wrong (their page's error, left for Nathalie to fix on their site). The earlier KTH-RPL candidate research chased that wrong name and is moot. Link supplied directly by Kyle (LinkedIn, tracking params stripped). LinkedIn blocks anonymous probes (HTTP 999 for live and dead profiles alike), so check_urls.py reports this link as unverifiable rather than passing/failing it — verify in a browser. | https://www.linkedin.com/in/finnj-breuer/ |
