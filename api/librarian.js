/* The librarian: a serverless search agent that walks this site's own graphs.

   It no longer re-ranks a list the browser found — it SEARCHES. A free chat
   model reads the site's knowledge graphs out of this function's own deployment
   bundle and answers the query in at most two hops:

     hop 1 — survey  the query, the browser's keyword candidates (which MAY be
                     empty: a query with no keyword hits is exactly the one this
                     exists for) and a compact catalog of every page, every
                     repository and every CAD part, each carrying an id. The
                     model answers {"hits":[{id,why}], "open":[repo,…]}.
     hop 2 — walk    only when the keyword list was short and hop 1 opened a
                     repository: the opened repositories' graph shards, their
                     file lists, the symbols whose names match the query, and
                     the wiki-graph neighbours of the hop-1 hits — all in
                     catalog id space. The model answers the final {"hits":…}.

   Hop 2 is ADDITIVE AND RE-ORDERING, never subtractive: it may insert and
   re-rank, but it cannot erase what the survey found, and an empty answer from
   it is a failed walk rather than a confident "nothing matches".

   Every id the model returns is validated against real data on the way out and
   turned into a row whose id and href are BYTE-IDENTICAL to the row
   js/search.js would have built for the same entry (pages → the hash route,
   repositories → the GitHub URL, CAD and code → the blob URL with its #L
   anchor). Anything that does not resolve is dropped, so a hallucinated id can
   never reach the page.

   RAW NODE, ON PURPOSE. Nothing here touches a Vercel-injected convenience:
   the request body is read off the stream, parsed explicitly, and every answer
   goes out through writeHead/end. That is what lets tools/dev_site.mjs pass a
   plain http server's request and response straight in, so local behaviour is
   identical to deployed behaviour instead of merely similar.

   This file is the Kyle-gated half of the feature. The site works completely
   without it: GitHub Pages answers a POST to a missing path with 405, which the
   client reads as "no function on this host" and silently latches off.

   Contract with the client (js/search.js):
     in   POST {"q": "...", "candidates": [{id,title,kind,where,snippet}, ...]}
               candidates must be an array; it may be EMPTY.
     out  200  {"results":[{"id","why"[,"kind","title","where","href","snippet"]},…],
                "provider","model","promptChars","temperature","calls","hops",
                "ms","partial"}
          400  malformed request       413  body too large
          403  cross-origin            429  rate limited
          405  wrong method            500  a file missing from the bundle
          502  {"error","providers":[{provider,hop,reason}],"exhausted"}
     EVERY answer, the pre-body 405/403/429 included, carries
     `x-librarian-version: 2`. It costs nothing — no body read, no model call —
     and is the zero-quota readiness probe: the old handler answers 405 without
     it, this one with it, so a deploy can be confirmed before a request is
     spent against a stale deployment.

   Keys live in the environment and nowhere else. They are never logged, never
   written to a file, and never put into a prompt. */

/* FREE MODELS ONLY — Kyle's decision (2026-09-04): "set and forget", no spend.
   Both entries are `:free` variants on OpenRouter, so nothing is ever billed.
   What free costs, plainly: OpenRouter caps free-model requests per key at
   ~20/min and, for an account that never bought $10 of credit, 50/day. A
   throttled answer is an error here and the client falls back to the local
   index, so the site never breaks — it just answers keyword-only past the cap.

   ONE GATEWAY, TWO MODELS — a real trade, recorded rather than glossed over.
   Groq's signup was inoperable and NVIDIA's own API sits behind a manual
   verification queue, so both entries ride OpenRouter. An OpenRouter outage
   takes both paths with it: the fallback below buys model-level resilience
   (one model timing out, refusing, or answering unparseably), NOT gateway-
   level resilience. The per-provider URL overrides are kept separate so one
   path can still be broken deliberately (the fallback drill) and so either
   entry can be repointed at a direct vendor endpoint the moment one is
   reachable.

   HOW THESE TWO WERE CHOSEN (measured 2026-09-04, 15 real queries each through
   this handler, temperature 0, 5s deadline — see tools/bench_librarian.mjs):
     nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free   13/15  median 2955ms  top-1 12/15  (2 timeouts)
     nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b:free  8/15  median 1790ms  top-1  7/15  (6 empty answers)
     nemotron-3.5-lightning:free        1/15  (14 timeouts)
     nemotron-3-ultra-550b:free         0/15  (15 timeouts)
     gemma-4-26b / gemma-4-31b :free    0/15  ("temporarily rate-limited upstream")
     glm-5.2:free                       1/15  (rate-limited upstream)
     minimax-m2.7:free                  0/15  (refuses reasoning: disabled)
   Super is the only free model that works; nano is a different, faster model
   for the moments Super is slow, which a retry of Super would not cover. Both
   are hybrid Mamba-Transformer MoEs, not Llama derivatives (policy). */

   spends real provider quota — and one request now costs up to three upstream
   calls. The two gates below raise the cost of abusing that. They are NOT
   authentication:

     - the Origin gate stops a browser on another site from spending the quota,
       because a JSON POST is preflighted and no permissive CORS header is ever
       sent back. A `curl` with a forged Origin (or none) still gets through.
     - the rate limit is per serverless INSTANCE and lives in that instance's
       memory. Instances are not shared and are recycled, so this throttles a
       sustained attacker per instance rather than globally; a distributed
       caller with many source addresses is not stopped by it at all.
